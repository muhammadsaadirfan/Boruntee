## 1. Introduction

#### This project demonstrates how to simulate, control, and plan motions for the **Boruntee 2030a** robotic arm using **ROS 2 Humble**, **Gazebo**, and **MoveIt!**. You'll learn how to launch Boruntee in simulation, set up path planning pipelines, and experiment with hardware-like control.

## 2. What is the  Boruntee 2030a?

The **Boruntee 2030a** is an industrial welding, heavy weight lifting robot:

- **ROS-based robot arm control**  
- **MoveIt motion planning pipelines**  
- **Gazebo simulation with URDF & meshes**  
- **Trajectory execution and visualization in RViz**

Unlike mobile robots, robotic arms require **inverse kinematics (IK)**, **path planning**, and **gripper/tool integration**. This project provides a structured way to explore those concepts with the Boruntee model.

Think of this as your **training ground for industrial robotics**. Instead of dealing with expensive hardware, you get the same software architecture in a safe simulated environment.
